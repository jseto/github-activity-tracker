## Using Repository Activity Tracker

The repository activity tracker allows you to explore and track repositories from your favourite cloud repository (currently only GitHub is available, plugins for GitLab and Bitbucket are on the way).

### Setup remote repository API key

If you receive errors about reaching the maximum API access quota, you can set your own API key in the input box and click **Set API key and Store** button. You only need to set the _API key_ once as it is stored in the cookie for your convenience. Be aware that your _API key_ is not encrypted in the cookie and someone gaining unauthorized access to your computer can steal your _API key_. 

To get your **GitHub** _API key_ follow the instructions in [this document](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app)

### Looking for repositories in an organization

Enter the desired organization in the input box to retrieve a list of the organization
repositories. Once all the repositories are downloaded, you can filter them by name
using the _filter input_.

Click on a repository card to get detailed information and commits of the repository
in a modal dialog. Close the dialog by clicking on the top-right **X** to get back to 
the repository list.

Additionally, in the detailed view, you can mark the repository by clicking on the **Track this repo** button.
